# policies/invoice_policy.py
"""
InvoicePolicy — Invoice status rules, built on TransitionEngine.

States (from `invoice_status` enum, stored lowercase):
    unpaid, paid, canceled, partially_paid, overdue, refunded

Transitions (from the state diagram):

    unpaid          → partially_paid
    unpaid          → paid
    unpaid          → overdue
    unpaid          → canceled

    partially_paid  → paid
    partially_paid  → overdue
    partially_paid  → canceled

    overdue         → paid
    overdue         → canceled

    paid            → refunded

Predicates take an `Invoice` instance directly. External signals (amount
received, refund completed, write-off authorised) come in as keyword
arguments on `decide(...)`.

The invoice carries `invoice_total_amount`, `invoice_due_date`, and
`invoice_status`. Predicates that reason about partial vs. full payment
receive the captured amount as a keyword argument — the invoice itself
has no "paid so far" column, so the caller (usually after summing its
payments) supplies it.
